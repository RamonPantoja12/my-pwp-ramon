Purpose,Audience and Goal

1. Purpose: I want to be able to display my skills and to show potential employers what I'm capable of bringing to their
company. Essentially this portfolio will showcase my educational background, profile, goals, interests and my resume to the employers.
This portfolio will be the first impression for employers to see what type of person they would like to hire. This will be a strong well detailed first impression.

2. Audience: This portfolio is intended mainly for potential employers but also for fellow tech professionals for ideas
or inspiration. The target audience for my personal portfolio would be individuals who are looking to hire a
 web developer that are best suited for them. The audience can also be potential clients that i have networked with.

3. Goal: The goal of this personal portfolio to showcase my work to attract employers or freelance clients.
My personal portfolio is intended to promote my work and serve as a gallery for the targeted audience.
