Purpose,Audience and Goal

1. Purpose: I want to be able to display my skills and to show potential employers what I'm capable of bringing to their
company. Essentially this portfolio will showcase my educational background, profile, goals, interests and my resume to the employers.
This portfolio will be the first impression for employers to see what type of person they would like to hire. This will be a strong well detailed first impression.

2. Audience: This portfolio is intended mainly for potential employers but also for fellow tech professionals for ideas
or inspiration. The target audience for my personal portfolio would be individuals who are looking to hire a
 web developer that are best suited for them. The audience can also be potential clients that i have networked with.

3. Goal: The goal of this personal portfolio to showcase my work to attract employers or freelance clients.
My personal portfolio is intended to promote my work and serve as a gallery for the targeted audience.

Name: Jim Halpert

Age: 36

Job: Kforce Professional Staffing Agency

Role: Tech recruiter

Location: Tampa, Florida

Technology: Jim uses his Macbook laptop mainly for networking through Email, Skype and LinkedIn. He uses his cellphone
for communication with his clients.

Goals: He wants to see if the creator of the website possesses the skills and experience that are best suited for the company
that he is recruiting for.

Frustration: The profiles or websites Jim comes across are not well presented or are lacking critical skills
that his client is requesting. Jim is a very busy man and as much as he avoids trying to waste time he may come
across candidates who dont fit the job description or fails to respond. Jim spends hours on the phone through out his work
day. Recruiting can be very similar to sales so the hunt can be tiresome.

User Story: Jim uses my website as the first impression as of what value i can bring to the company.
